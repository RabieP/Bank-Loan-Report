# ðŸ“Š Bank Loan Report  

## Overview  
This project analyzes lending operations, borrower demographics, and loan performance using interactive dashboards in Power BI. The goal is not only to track KPIs but also to **tell the story of borrower behavior, loan health, and financial risk**.  

## Objective  
To build a data-driven reporting system that:  
- Summarizes key loan metrics (applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, DTI).  
- Classifies loan performance into *Good* vs. *Bad* categories.  
- Identifies trends by issue date, state, loan term, employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership.  
- Provides interactive filtering for deeper exploration.  

## Insights  
- Highlighted lending patterns across borrower segments and geographies.  
- Identified risk factors linked to bad loans (e.g., shorter employment history, certain loan purposes).  
- Assessed overall financial health by comparing funded vs. received amounts.  
- Helped reveal strategic opportunities for lenders to improve decision-making.  

## Tools & Technologies
